This is a library for reading magnetic stripes through PCM audio data.

As of version 1.1, it supports both the numeric-only ABA encoding as found on
track 2 of most magnetic stripe cards, and the alpha-numeric IATA encoding as
found on track 1, occasionally track 3, and other magnetic stripes such as
those found on airline boarding passes.

Additionally, for non-standard coding schemes, the raw bitstream can be
accessed to allow for the character decoding to occur elsewhere.

Included in this package:
mslib - The library
mstest - a C program to test the library with PCM audio files

mslib and mstest are tersely documented.  The latter should provide a basic
usage example.  Refer to mslib.h for additional documentation.

Requirements:
mslib should be compatible with any C99 implementation.
mstest should be compatible with any C99 POSIX implementation (for mmap)

To compile mslib and mstest, run "make".
